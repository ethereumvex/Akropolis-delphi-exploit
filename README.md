We have the hacker's EOA wallet (0x9f26ae5cd245bfeeb5926d61497550f79d9c6c1c) deploy an ERC-20 (0xe2307837524db8961c4541f943598654240bd62f). This contract then approves to spend DAI on 0x73fc3038b4cd8ffd07482b92a52ea806505e5748. It then deposits it's ERC-20 (5,000,000), and when transferFrom is called, the malicious ERC's transferFrom method has a re-entrancy to deposit, this time depositing the approved DAI.
